from this tutorial we will start new
training series
for solidworks 2020. if you want to see
more such type of videos then please
subscribe to my channel
and press the bell icon let's start
when you start solidworks many of you
may be seeing this welcome window
you can start working in part
environment
by clicking on this part button here and
if you don't have this welcome window
then
you will have to click here on new
button
it will show this window if you have
selected advance
and if you have selected this then it
will show this window
so in this window you can start part by
clicking here
and by clicking on ok
and if you have this advanced window
select this part and click on ok
so it will start part environment now
in this tutorial at first we will learn
some basic
sketch commands to switch to sketch
environment
click here on sketch and click here
on this sketch button as we are only
going to create
some 2d sketches therefore you can
select
any plane suppose i will select this top
plane now here
i have selected this mmgs unit
by clicking on this you can choose your
desire unit
so they have provided mks cgs
ips and mmgs so i will be working with
this
mmgs units so this mmgs
have millimeter gram and second click
outside
first command we will learn line here is
the line command
keyboard shortcut is l click on line
then you will have to specify first
point
always ensure that when starting a new
sketch
always use this origin so that your
sketch will be fully defined
and properly constrained click first
point here
take your cursor away now here in this
yellow box
you can see that there is horizontal
line
this yellow box with some symbol is
called as
relations so it indicates horizontal
relation
that means the line you are going to
create will be horizontal
and here also you can see that angle
indicated is 180 degree
click to stop line command press escape
so here this horizontal line is created
and this horizontal relation has been
applied to it
to give dimension to this line click
here on smart dimension
click on this line take your cursor
below
and click specify length of line suppose
i want
line of 80 distance type there 80
and press enter and to stop dimension
command
press escape so here this line of 80
distance is
created click on line
take your cursor to this end point these
two circle indicates
it is catching endpoint click and take
your cursor above
so here now it is showing yellow box
with vertical line
that means your line is straight and is
vertical
click then by clicking points
you can create your shape as per your
requirement
and as you take your cursor here you can
see that
it is automatically tracking from the
origin click there
and click once your shape got close
line command automatically stopped there
and
it has filled with blue color the
meaning of this filling is that
this shape is perfectly close and is
suitable for
3d creation and if you don't want to see
this filling
then you can turn it off by clicking on
this shaded sketched contours
so it will remove those filling but i
will recommend you
to keep this filling because it will be
very useful
when creating 3d objects
to stop line command press escape
here also you can observe there are two
colors for
line object one is in blue color and one
is in
black color the object which are with
black color
for which location is defined with
respect to this
origin and suppose if you want to
convert this horizontal line into black
color
you will have to define location of that
line the location of this line will be
the length of this line
so click on smart dimension
click on this line take your cursor on
this side and click
then specify length and press enter
so here you can see that this line is
also converted to black color
right now this sketch is under defined
the meaning of under defined
is you still will have to give
parameters and dimensions to completely
define this sketch
suppose we will also give length of this
line 25
enter then press escape then suppose i
want this line
collinear with this line so to
add relations select this line
press ctrl and select this line
so here list of relations has been shown
from here you can add this make
collinear
so they will become collinear and this
symbol of collinear is added
which shows that these two lines are
collinear
click outside and these two lines has
become black
because they are properly defined
again smart dimension suppose i want to
give length of this line
as 25 enter
then length of this line again as 25
enter click outside now if you see that
complete sketch got black color and it
has been said here that
it is fully defined now if you try to
give dimension
then it will be over defined suppose if
i try to give length of this line
and click here it will give error
that make dimension driven and your
sketch got
over defined because this dimension is
not necessary
as we have already specified this total
length
and we have defined these two lengths
that means
this length can be easily work out or
there is no need to specify this length
because this length is already included
in this length
so this problem can be solved in two
ways you can make this dimension as a
driven
or you can leave this dimension as
driving
if you need this dimension as a
reference dimension
then you can make this dimension as a
driven
click on ok and click outside
so here this driven dimension is shown
in gray color
and all the other dimension are shown in
black color
the meaning of this driven dimension is
that if i
change any dimension in this line this
will get
changed suppose if i change
this dimension to change dimension
you will have to double click on that
dimension so here
dialog box will appear here you will
have to specify
change dimension suppose i want it 20
enter so here you can see that it
automatically got 35
and the black dimension remain as it is
so that is the meaning of driven
dimension so it will get
changed automatically without giving any
indication to you
then press escape to stop dimension
command
then suppose i want to make this
dimension as a driven dimension
for that click on this dimension line of
this dimension
right click and here you will have to
click on this driven
and press escape so here you can see
that this dimension has become driven
and suppose i want to convert this
dimension to driving dimension
again click on this line right click
and click on this driven so that it
will
make this dimension driving so
if i now change this dimension to 20
enter so here you can see that now this
dimension got
changed so this is the concept of driven
and driving dimension i don't want this
dimension
so just click and press delete button
so that dimension is removed again click
on smart dimension
again select this line take your cursor
above and click
and if you click on this leave this
dimension driving
and click on ok then your sketch will
become
over defined so once your sketch got
over defined then you have two options
you can either delete one of the not
required dimension
or you can convert one dimension to
driven dimension
suppose i don't want this dimension so
select it and delete it
so here you can see that our sketch is
fully defined
then press escape to remove these
objects
press first mouse button and drag the
mouse and release the mouse
and then press delete button on keyboard
then
if you want to create some reference
center lines
for that click on this arrow near line
and click on center line
then suppose i want to create one center
line from this point click there
and click here then to stop
center line here double click so it will
stop creating that center line further
ahead
but your centerline command will be
still running so
i can create one more here and again
double click
i need one more here
then double click and escape so here you
can see that
these two lines are black because they
are
attached to this origin but this line is
blue
because we have not given any dimension
so to make it black
we will have to place one dimension
click on smart dimension
select this line select this line take
your cursor below
suppose i want dimension of 100 enter
press escape so here this line also got
black then to pan this drawing you will
have to press ctrl
press middle mouse button and drag the
mouse
to zoom it rotate middle mouse button
towards you
then it will zoom it and if you rotate
middle mouse button towards monitor
then it will zoom minus suppose i will
zoom it
i will rotate middle mouse button
towards me then suppose i want to create
one circle here for that click here on
circle
take your cursor on this origin click
center point here
on origin take your cursor away and
click
then i want to create circle on the
intersection of these two center lines
so take your cursor there here it is
showing intersection
object snap click there
and click press escape
for dimension click on smart dimension
select this circle take your cursor
outside and click
specify diameter of 60 enter
we will just pan it below press ctrl
press middle mouse button and drag the
mouse
then click on the circle take your
cursor outside
and click specify diameter of 40
enter press escape
and suppose i want to create one tangent
line
so click on this line take your cursor
here
and click take your cursor on this side
once it shows the tangent symbol click
there
and double click so here tangent
line has been created and suppose if you
want to create
line away you can also create it away
press escape to apply tangent object
snap
select the circle press ctrl select this
line
and from here you can apply tangent
relation
click click outside
select the circle press ctrl and click
on this line
again click on make tangent so here this
line got tangent
properly then suppose if you want to
remove these extra lines
you will have to use trim entities click
on trim entities
easiest method is trim to closest
in this method it will remove the object
on which you clicks
so here you can see that here is a extra
line
that also we can remove to see complete
object
you can directly click on this zoom to
fit or you can also press
f so here this has been trimmed properly
then same way you can remove these
internal objects also
just click on it so those objects will
be
removed you can also use zoom to area
to zoom a particular area click
then press first mouse button drag the
mouse and release the mouse
press escape and click
again zoom to fit now here you can see
that
still it is not shaded for 3d objects
so there is one more problem here again
zoom to area
press first mouse button drag the mouse
release the mouse
press escape and click
zoom to fit so here it got properly
filled
that means it is properly closed
this power trim is also useful tool
suppose i want to remove these outside
center lines
then click on this power trim to use
power trim you will have to press first
mouse button
and drag the mouse so whichever object
is crossed
by this gray line those objects will be
trimmed
so that is power trim then corner
for corner we can create some objects
suppose i will create some lines so that
it will be easy to explain corner
double click click and escape
then again trim entities then corner
then suppose i want to remove this
portion so in the case of corner you
will have to click on the objects you
want to keep
so it will remove the objects ahead of
that intersection
point just click on the objects you want
to
keep suppose i want to keep object from
this side
so click on this line so in this way you
can use corner
so it will trim it and it will also
extend suppose if i click on this line
and this line
so it will extend this line and it will
create corner
so in this way you can use corner tool
then trim away inside press escape
i will create some more lines
zoom there pan it escape
then click on trim entities trim away
inside
for this you will have to define
boundary inside which you want to trim
the object
click on the object you want to trim so
it will automatically trim
object from inside this boundary and you
can also use window selection
press first mouse button and drag the
mouse and release the mouse
it will automatically select those
objects and in this case
it will remove internal objects press
escape
then for undo you can click here on undo
and
ctrl z is shortcut so i will just undo
it
again trim entities next is trim away
outside
click then select objects
outside which you want to trim so i will
select these two lines
i will use this window selection click
first mouse button drag the mouse and
release the mouse
so here objects from both the sides has
been removed with reference to
these two lines and we have already seen
this trim to closest
trim to closest can also be used for
removing the
objects zoom to fit
then there are two more options keep
trimmed entities as construction
geometry
so even though you trim it it will keep
it as a reference
line suppose i will just undo it
so i will have those objects
and i will click on trim entities then i
will take here
keep trim entities as construction
geometry
and suppose i will trim this line so
here you can see that
that line has been trimmed but it has
been kept as a reference geometry or
construction geometry
so this geometry will be there for
reference but
it will not be the part of your sketch
for 3d creation
so in this way you can use this trim
entities as construction
geometry then there is ignore trimming
of construction geometry
now these are the construction
geometries if you tick here
and suppose if i use this power trim so
when i will power trim
it will only trim the entities it will
not remove these construction
objects so even though you take your
cursor over it
it will not remove it so this is a very
useful feature
because number of times we want to
remove actually main objects and we
don't want to remove
center lines or reference lines press
escape
one more command we will see that is
mirror entities
we'll just pan it and we will create one
entity here
for mirror
suppose i will create one sketch like
this
press escape for mirror you will have to
create
center line also to define as a mirror
center line click on center line
and i will create one horizontal center
line
double click and one vertical center
line
press escape i want to mirror this
entity
select this entity using windows
selection
click on mirror entities
click here on mirror about
and select the center line and click on
ok so here this mirror has been created
around this center line
again mirror entities select these lines
if you want you can remove the original
object and keep the mirror image
suppose i want this object below on the
opposite side
and i want to remove from here for that
remove this copy option
click here on mirror about and select
this horizontal center line
and click on ok so here it has removed
the original object
and it has kept mirror entity so in this
way you can use mirror entities
then sometimes if you rotate this object
by mistake
you can go back to original view by
clicking here on previous view
zoom to fit so that's all in the next
tutorial
we will solve some exercises based on
this theory lecture
so thanks for watching we will stop here
