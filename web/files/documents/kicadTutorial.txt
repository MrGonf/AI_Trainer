[Music] hi and welcome to getting started with 
kicad I'm Sean he Mel and throughout this video  
series I'll be showing you how to create this 
custom board from scratch if you're curious  
we'll be making a badge that pulses a couple of 
LEDs the white area around the LEDs allows you  
to draw or write something fun using a sharpie 
that way you can customize and wear your badge  
with pride at your next event don't worry you can 
erase the sharpie with a little bit of rubbing  
alcohol I worked with my friends at digi-key to 
make these videos whenever I'm creating a custom  
PCB I always check digi-key first for components 
in fact we'll be using their site later in this  
series to order parts for the board but first 
let's talk about why you would even want to make  
a PCB in the first place in the 1960s telephone 
crossbar switches like the one shown here used  
a wiring technique that involved wrapping small 
gauge wire around posts if we zoom in we can see  
the individual wire wraps and notice that no 
solder was used to make these connections as  
electronics became more popular in the 60s and 
70s the wire wrapping technique was adapted to  
connect components together wire wrapping is an 
art unto itself often resulting in striking and  
beautiful patterns on the back of boards even 
though wire wrapping could be automated it was  
still relatively expensive and time consuming in 
the 1980s surface mount technology was gaining  
in popularity which ultimately resulted in 
electronics that were faster and cheaper  
to produce prior to surface mount boards were 
made with through-hole technology if conductive  
material is added to the inside of a hole to 
allow for a better connection this is known as  
a plated through-hole or PTH as you can see on 
this 1984 Sinclair QL computer the components  
were much larger and had leads that poke through 
holes in the board you would generally need to  
solder the leads to the board on the opposite 
side if you look closely at this Raspberry Pi  
you'll see that the electronic components do not 
have leads that extend through the board instead  
the components are placed in solder on just one 
layer this is known as surface mount technology  
or SMT surface mount technology is great when your 
mass producing hundreds or thousands of boards but  
it can be a pain disorder by hand so we're gonna 
stick to plated through-hole parts for our board  
it just makes things a little easier now that 
you know the history what is a PCB well it's an  
acronym that stands for a printed circuit board it 
is a board or card that electrically connects and  
mechanically supports electrical components these 
connections are made with a series of conductive  
tracks or traces usually copper and this copper 
is laminated onto or in between sheets of non  
conductive material like fiberglass if you were 
to take a cross section of a PCB and examine  
it under a microscope you would see a number of 
layers the substrate is the rigid or semi rigid  
material that holds everything together most 
PCBs you come across will use fiberglass and  
cured epoxy resin the epoxy is normally flame 
resistant and likely meets the flame-retardant  
grade for standard which is where fr4 comes from 
you'll often hear people refer to this material as  
just fr for a thin sheet of copper is pressed and 
heated onto the substrate this would be a single  
layer board which means that only one side of the 
board has conductive material on it another layer  
of copper can be added to the other side making 
it a 2 layer board which is what we'll be using  
you can even add more layers of substrate and 
copper to make multiple layered boards but we  
won't need to worry about those for this project 
they usually cost more and are reserved for more  
complex PCB layouts for our plated through holes 
a drill bores out a chunk of copper and substrate  
a thin layer of copper is then added to the inside 
of the hole using a process called electroplating  
note that this also deposits copper on all exposed 
surfaces so your main copper layer grows a tiny  
bit this small layer of conductive material is 
how you can make electrical connections between  
different layers of copper and is known as a 
plated through-hole copper is then etch door  
removed from the top and bottom layers leaving 
only the traces and pads that you specified  
in your design we could stop here and you would 
have a perfectly usable two layer PCB this board  
was made on a bantam tools PCB milling machine 
where copper is milled or routed off the board I  
can easily solder components to this and it would 
work well for a project or a prototype however it  
can be nice to add a layer of protection and help 
prevent short circuits when you say accidentally  
move a screwdriver across the board so a solder 
mask layer is often applied on top of most of the  
board this normally consists of a lacquer like 
polymer and is only put on surfaces where we  
don't want to solder components to it also helps 
prevent solder from creeping down the traces or  
jumping between traces traditionally this is green 
but ours will be purple because that's just the  
way our spark rolls when designing our board were 
usually worried about areas where we don't want  
solder mask to be which we'll call solder mask 
keep out these will usually be colored areas on  
a layer around things like pins and pads places 
where we want exposed copper such as the top and  
bottom of our through-hole shown here copper can 
oxidize which makes soldering to it difficult so  
most manufacturers will add a surface finish we'll 
have our board house use an electrolysis immersion  
gold or enig finish this gives any exposed traces 
or pads a gold color mix soldering easier and  
helps protect the copper underneath finally many 
board manufacturers will add a layer of ink in  
any pattern we want to help us identify components 
name the board or add silly artwork this is known  
as a silkscreen layer it's normally white but 
sometimes a board house will let us pick another  
color if we go back to our raspberry pi we can see 
the bare substrate which is brown or tan in color  
some exposed copper which has been given a gold 
colored finish green solder mask on most of the  
board and white silk screen if you were to slice 
into the PCB and look at a cross-section under  
a microscope you would find that the Raspberry 
Pi has six layers of copper which is a lot more  
complicated than the board we'll be making with 
the basic understanding of how PCBs are made let's  
talk about what it takes to design one these days 
most PCBs are designed in a computer-aided design  
software or CAD program for short while each PCB 
CAD program operates a little differently they  
all generally have a similar flow it's important 
to keep in mind that kicad is really a collection  
of programs that work together to help you design 
a board the first step is to design your circuit  
and this can be based on something you found 
online created in a simulator or constructed  
on a breadboard we won't cover circuit design in 
these videos as that's really outside the scope of  
building a PCB in fact we already have the circuit 
designed it's just a 555 timer that causes some  
LEDs to fade in and out before we can create a 
schematic we may need to create custom schematic  
symbols if we can't find some in the kicad or 
digi-key libraries we then draw our circuit in  
the software schematic capture program which is 
known as EE schema in kicad we can research the  
exact parts we need on digi Keys website from 
there we can look at each part datasheet to  
determine what the footprint should be when I say 
footprint I'm referring to the configuration of  
pads and holes on the PCB used to mechanically 
and electrically attach components for example  
these eight holes make up the footprint for 
our 555 timer component if we can't find the  
footprints for our parts in the libraries we'll 
need to create our own using the kicad footprint  
editor then we use cvpcb to associate schematic 
symbols with footprints still in EE schema we  
generate a netlist which is just a text document 
that tells which pins are electrically connected  
to other pins in the circuit we open up our board 
layout program known as pcbnew and set up our  
design rules as specified by the PCB manufacturer 
which we can usually find on their website we then  
import our netlist which places our parts in the 
program we move the parts around as we see fit and  
draw copper connections known as traces between 
the necessary pins after that we generate a set of  
files known as Gerber's that represent the various 
layers of the board we wish to make we can use the  
view program in kicad to examine these files 
before we send them to the manufacturer finally  
we create a bill of materials or bomb and order 
the electronic components from digi-key once  
all the parts arrive we can solder them to the 
board to build the badge there are a number of  
PCB layout programs out there but in this series 
we'll be looking at kicad kicad is free and open  
source which makes it great for learning how to 
make your own PCBs but it's also powerful enough  
to do more complicated work for example the guts 
of this olam X DIY laptop were designed entirely  
in kicad if you're following along with these 
videos and you feel that you need some additional  
material to help you along I highly recommend 
checking out Chris Gamble's tutorials on kicad  
which he titles getting to blinky for point out 
Chris takes a slightly different span and shows  
a few different tools which can be very useful 
when learning a new program Chris also helps  
run the kicad forums which you can find at forum 
kicad info here you can search for answers and  
ask questions to the community if you get stuck 
all right enough talking let's go download kicad  
so we can start making our board on the next 
episode head to kicad - PCB org and click the  
big download button choose your operating system 
which is windows for me follow any directions you  
might see here for example I'll choose to download 
the 64-bit version as I'm running a 64-bit version  
of Windows 10 follow whatever instructions are 
necessary to install kicad which could include  
running the Windows executable installing the 
disk image on Mac OS calling apt-get in Debian or  
building it from source code if you're so inclined 
if presented with installation options keep  
everything the default open kicad and you'll be 
presented with the project manager will create our  
555 timer badge project here and begin designing 
our board but that'll be on the next episode I  
hope this has given you some insights into how and 
why PCBs are made feel free to come back to this  
episode if you feel that you need a refresher on 
some of these terms see you next time you [Music]
